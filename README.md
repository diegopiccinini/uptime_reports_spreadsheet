# UptimeReportsSpreadsheet

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/uptime_reports_spreadsheet`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'uptime_reports_spreadsheet'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install uptime_reports_spreadsheet

## Usage

To have a connection you have to create 2 files:

- .env (to setup the ENV variables like GOOGLE_API_AUTH_CODE)
- client_secret.json (with your client secret data of Google console))


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
